	NVIDIA container runtime toolkit, build and run containers leveraging
	NVIDIA GPUs. tl;dr: nvidia-docker is deprecated because docker now has
	native gpu support, which this package is required to use. The NVIDIA
	Container Toolkit (formerly known as NVIDIA Docker) allows containers to
	access full GPU acceleration. OpenGL, OpenCL and CUDA are supported for
	production use. Vulkan support is currently in beta. This only works for
	Linux containers running on Linux host systems with NVIDIA GPUs.
